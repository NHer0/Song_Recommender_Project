# Song_Recommender_Project

**Objective**: In this project an Spotify Song Recommender has been built  from scratch. The project involved web Scraping to obtain a so called "hot songs" database and the use of Spotify API to build a diverse database with songs of many genres. This Spotify Database has been used to develop a kmeans clustering model and ultimately a audio features based song recommender.

**Tools used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup), Spotify API, sklearn**

**Aproach**: 

- First Prototype - Hot Song Recommender

This first prototype only includes the hot song recommender. The  flow chart of the recommender is as in image below.

- Second Prototype

The second and final prototype includes the hot song recommender and the audio features based recommender. The flow chart of the programm is as in image below.
