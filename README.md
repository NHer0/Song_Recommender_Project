# Song_Recommender_Project

**Objective**: In this project, a Spotify Song Recommender has been built from scratch. The project involved web Scraping to obtain a so called "hot songs" database (Billboard Top 100) and the use of Spotify API to build a diverse database with songs of many genres. This Spotify Database has been used to develop a kmeans clustering model and ultimately an audio features based song recommender.

**Tools used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup), Spotify API, sklearn**

**Aproach**: 

- First Prototype - Hot Song Recommender

This first prototype only includes the hot song recommender. The flow chart of the recommender is as in the image below.

- Second Prototype

The second and final prototype includes the hot song recommender and the audio features based recommender. The flow chart of the program is as in the image below.
